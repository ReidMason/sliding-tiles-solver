# Sliding Tiles Solver

Okay so basically it'll open the page and setup the game board state for you and find what the image is meant to look like.
Next you gotta make it so it figures out what move to make, clicks the board and makes the move and eventually wins the game. ðŸŽ‰

There isn't any logic to actually click the tiles etc but this should all be real easy to build in, some of the logic might need extracting but ehh that's no biggie right?

Also the code is kinda rough but not the absolute worst so it should be fine.
